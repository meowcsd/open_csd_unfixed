Bot is created by üá∑üá∫Russian coder Akim using Claude –∏ Kandinsky 2.1. It can talk with you, answer question and illustrate its messages with pictures.
Bot is in early development phase. If bot refuses to do something, first press "Reset" or type /reset. If that doesn't work, it's either the fault of Claude API and Kandinskiy (they may be temporarily unavailable), or the bot is broken (most likely). In any case, write to ???.
Write to the creator of the bot: https://t.me/...
